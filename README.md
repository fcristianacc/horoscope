# Horoscope Application

This is an application in React and Flask which presents informations about the Zodiac Signs.

My main goal is to learn these frameworks and get skills in Javascript and Python.

## Installation

To run the application we need to have _node.js_ and _yarn_ installed and run the command `flask run` inside the backend directory and then run `yarn start` inside the frontend directory.

Finally, we simply go to the http://localhost:3000/ to access this fancy page and enjoy it!
